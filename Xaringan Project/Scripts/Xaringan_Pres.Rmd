# What is Xaringan?  

Xaringan is an R package used to create HTML presentations using Rmarkdown interfaces.  

Slides created by Xaringan are rendered by remark.js (an HTML JavaScript presentation program) and converted to an HTML form from R markdown.  

An understanding of **remark.js** is a good place to start!!

1. Markdown-driven slideshow tool
1. Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:
   - A line containing **three dashes** constitutes a new slide (---)
2. remark.js does not support R, only Markdown
3. Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser
4. remark.js can be thought of as a precursor to xaringan - xaringan understands R ]

.right-column[
1. R Markdown extension that uses remark.js to generate HTML slides
1. The name originates from Naruto
2. Very customizable and has multiple uses including theme customization and more
1. Some features include:
   - Autoplay
   - Countdown
   - Highlighting Code

Hi !!!!!!

# Let's Get Started with Xaringan

Everyone should go ahead and install xaringan using:

```{r,eval=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("xaringan")   #<< 
#install xaringan straight from R packages
```

Now...

# Adding R code

- Adding a R code chunk to the presentation is the same as in a RMarkdown document.

  - Using **Ctrl+Alt+I** _(for both windows and mac)_ still works 
  
  - Example:
.pull-center[
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
]  

---
  
# Higlighting Code
- You can highlight code by using '{{}}' or '#<<':

  - Example:
  
```{r}
{{Chem_Data <- read.csv(here("Xaringan Project", "Data", "chemicaldata_maunalua.csv"))}}
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Clean_Chem_Data <- Chem_Data %>%
  drop_na()
```

- _You can also use a leading asterisk but it is harder to use compared to the brackets_
---

# Adding Plots

- Plots are fairly easy to add.

- Use an R Code Chunk and plot like you normally would.

.pull-left[
```{r, exampleplot, eval= FALSE, message=FALSE}
#.pull-left[        #<<
Clean_Chem_Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NN,
             y = Phosphate,
             color = Zone))+
  geom_point(size = 2.5)+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_color_viridis_d()+
  facet_wrap(~Zone)#]       #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r exampleplot-out, ref.label="exampleplot", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

]
---

# Adding a plot

- To make the code chunk and plot separate, you need to use:

  - Two seperate R code chunks
  
      - One contains the code for the plot but add **eval = FALSE** to the {r} section to keep the plot from showing.
    
      - The other is a R code chunk that uses the name given to the plot code chunk but instead adds _-out_ to the end.
    
          - Add **ref.label="plot name"** to show the plot.
      
- You can then use **pull-left[]**, **pull-right[]**, and **pull-center[]** around the code chunks to move them on the slide.

  - _When using these funtions makes sure to put a "." in front of them_
---

# Adding a Table

- You are able to add a kable table to the presentation

  - _Make sure it is in HTML format or it will not work_
  
  - Example:
  
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(Chem_Data[, 1:5]), format = 'html')
```
---

# Autoplay

- You can enable _autoplay_ by adding to the **nature** section of the YAML at the beginning of the presentation.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    nature:
      {{autoplay: 50000}}
```

- To make the presentation loop after it ends, add the sub-option called _loop_ to **TRUE**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    nature:
      autoplay:
        interval: 50000
        loop: true   #<< 
```
