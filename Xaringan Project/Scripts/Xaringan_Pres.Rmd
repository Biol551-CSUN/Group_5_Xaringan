# What is Xaringan?  

Xaringan is an R package used to create HTML presentations using Rmarkdown interfaces.  

Slides created by Xaringan are rendered by remark.js (an HTML JavaScript presentation program) and converted to an HTML form from R markdown.  

An understanding of **remark.js** is a good place to start!!

1. Markdown-driven slideshow tool
1. Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:
   - A line containing **three dashes** constitutes a new slide (---)
2. remark.js does not support R, only Markdown
3. Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser
4. remark.js can be thought of as a precursor to xaringan - xaringan understands R ]

# Let's Get Started with Xaringan

Everyone should go ahead and install xaringan using:

```{r,eval=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("xaringan")   #<< 
library(xaringan)
#install and run xaringan straight from R packages
```
--
Now...  

--
We can open a new R Markdown document by going to **File** <- **New File** <- **R Markdown**

# YAML Text: Xaringan Setup

Now name your document something useful: Such as "My first Xaringan Presentation"

We then want to select **"From Template"**  

--
<p align="center">
<img src="../Data/Xaringan_Name.png" alt="Xaringan Name" width="450" height="250">
</p>  
--
Then we want to scroll down and select "Ninja Presentation" from our template menu

# YAML Text: Xaringan Setup

Now delete everything that isn't the YAML text the bottom of the YAML text should look like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# THIS IS WHAT A YAML AND INTRO SLIDE LOOK LIKE IN XARINGAN
title: "Penguin Presentation"
subtitle: "⚔️<br/>"
author: "Your name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:

# Get Started

Hi !!!!!!}

```

Now we have the base of Xaringan Presentation!!!!
---

# How do we separate slides?  

- Using three dashes (---) directly in our R markdown document we can separate slides

--

- These three dashes should be on their own line after the last text or code we want to put in that slide
- Example:
```{r eval=FALSE}
--- #<<
  # Slide 1 
  
  Text, text, text, text, code
--- #<<
  # Slide 2 
  
  Text, text, text, text, list, code
--- #<<
```

---

# Adding R code

- Adding a R code chunk to the presentation is the same as in a RMarkdown document.

--

  - Using **Ctrl+Alt+I** _(for both windows and mac)_ still works 
  
--
  
  - Example:
.pull-center[
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
]  

---
  
# Higlighting Code
- You can highlight code by using '{{}}' or '#<<':

--

- I tend to like using the "#<<" after my code to highlight it

--

  - Example:
  
```{r}
{{Chem_Data <- read.csv(here("Xaringan Project", "Data", "chemicaldata_maunalua.csv"))}}
# Highlights the area you surround with the {{}}
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Clean_Chem_Data <- Chem_Data %>%
  drop_na()
```

--
- _You can also use a leading asterisk but it is harder to use compared to the brackets_
---
# Adding Images to a Xaringan Slide

- Adding images to a xaringan slide is a relatively easy process

--

- It is the same as adding images to a R Markdown document with a few extra steps

--

> You can input the position of these images using a content class (ex: .center)

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Adding Local images - these images should be in the same folder as the project
.center[![Inputs](libs/images/InputOutput2.PNG)] # input path to the image

# Adding images from the web - add the URL
.center[![Inputs](www.BIO551.com/giveusanA.png] # insert the url to the image

```

---

# Adding Plots

- Plots are fairly easy to add.

--

- Use an R Code Chunk and plot like you normally would.

--

.pull-left[
```{r, exampleplot, eval= FALSE, message=FALSE}
#.pull-left[        #<<
Clean_Chem_Data %>%     
  ggplot(aes(x = NN,
             y = Phosphate,
             color = Zone))+  # Bases the colors off of the Zone they were in
  geom_point(size = 2.5)+  # makes a basic point plot and changes the size of the points
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+ # Adds lines to the plot
  theme_bw()+   # Uses a black and white theme
  scale_color_viridis_d()+  # Color blind friendly color palette
  facet_wrap(~Zone)#]       #<<  # Facets the plot based on Zone
# Just a basic plot to illustrate how adding a plot to the slides works
# Only shows the code and not the plot itself
```
]



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggsave(here("Xaringan Project", "Output", "Example Plot.png"))
# Saves the image
```


.pull-right[
```{r exampleplot-out, ref.label="exampleplot", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Adds the image of the plot to the slides.
```

]
---

# Adding a plot

- To make the code chunk and plot separate, you need to use:

--

  - Two separate R code chunks
  
      - One contains the code for the plot but add **eval = FALSE** to the {r} section to keep the plot from showing.
    
      - The other is a R code chunk that uses the name given to the plot code chunk but instead adds _-out_ to the end.
    
          - Add **ref.label="plot name"** to show the plot.

--
      
- You can then use **pull-left[]**, **pull-right[]**, and **pull-center[]** around the code chunks to move them on the slide.

--

  - _When using these functions makes sure to put a "." in front of them_
---

# Adding a Table

- You are able to add a kable table to the presentation

--

  - _Make sure it is in HTML format or it will not work_
  
--
  
  - Example:
  
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(Chem_Data[, 1:5]), format = 'html')
# Adds a table to the slide
```
---

# Autoplay

- You can enable _autoplay_ by adding to the **nature** section of the YAML at the beginning of the presentation.

--


```{r, eval = FALSE}
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    nature:
   {{autoplay: 50000}}
# This makes iot so the slides change automatically at a specific time
```

--

- To make the presentation loop after it ends, add the sub-option called _loop_ to **TRUE**

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    nature:
      autoplay:
        interval: 50000
        loop: true   #<< 
# Loops the presentation after it is over
```

---
# Slide Layout

- Using something called **content classes** we can assign classes to elements that can alter the display of our slides!!

--

- Examples include:
```{r eval=FALSE}
#.pull-left["element"] or .pull-right["element"] where our element can be 
# an image, text, or a list

.pull-left[ 
- Bullet point

- Another bullet point
]

.pull-right[
![an image](blank.png)
]

.center []

.right-column[] 
```


---
# Macros

- Change the size of pictures
  - use code: `<img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />`

--
 
<img src= "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/743156951572414472/rzyTdiiR_400x400.jpg" + url +  style="width: 50%" />

---
# Presenter Notes

- Presenter can create notes within the script that won't be shown in slides!

--

- To create hidden slides, all you need is to type "???" after the text you want to be shown and before the notes you want to create.

--

- To view these notes just click [p] in the presenter view, you will have to check settings to not mirror displays

--

For Example:
```{r eval = FALSE}
???
you cant see me :-:
  
# this will hide text written below the question marks 
```

---
# Yolo - TRUE

- You must be wondering why there is a random picture of some guy with a mustache, this is a YAML option that comes standard in the xaringan package 

--

- This option will randomly insert a picture of Karl Broman into your slides 

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true #<<
---
# you can also use yolo:true to add other pictures
  
---
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo:
      img: image.png # image #<<
      times: 5 # how many times do you want this to show up randomly #<<
---
  
```

---
# Incremental Slides

- Another essential aspect to Xaringan is the use of Incremental slides, which has been used throughout this presentation  

--

- The use of incremental slides is similar to that of a "click in" animation in powerpoint and will show text incrementally and is done by using a double dash (--)

--
- We can use incremental slides within our slide separations (---), make sure to **click return or "enter"** before placing a double dash to assign the next text to a different line

- Example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
--- 
  # Slide 1
  
  Text I want to show first

-- #<<
  Text I want to show second

-- #<<
  Text I want to show third

---
```
---
#Disadvantages of Xaringan

- A good understanding of CSS is needed to navigate the many themes and customization it takes to really change the Xaringan package into what you want it to look like

> You can keep the 'ninja' theme if you don't really want to change anything
  
- The output file can sometimes be challenging to work with so you should always output it to the browser since some images and other renderings might not show

- HTML widgets may also not work well with Xaringan

.center[![Pros](../Data/Pros_and_Cons.png)]
---

# Now it's your turn!

- It's your turn to create your **first Xaringan Presentation!**

---
# Create a title page

- Let's make a title page

--

- Type in the following script: 
```{r eval= FALSE}
---
title: "Penguin Presentation"
subtitle: "⚔<br/>"
author: "Your name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:   # This is the basic Xaringan YAML that comes standard with the package
    yolo: true
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
    # Changes the theme of Xaringan through a CSS theme.
    lib_dir: libs  # This creates a CSS folder that includes the themes we want for the directory
    nature: 
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      # This changes the style of highlights in our code chunks
      countIncrementalSlides: false # Doesn't count incremental slides as their own slides
---    
```
---
# Required Libraries

- Go ahead and add a code chunk and load these libraries:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

---

# Let's add a basic plot

- Create a basic plot using the penguins data set

```{r penguinplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,    # The values that I want to plot
                            y = flipper_length_mm,
                            color = species))+ # Will base color off of species
  geom_point()+   # Makes a basic point plot
  theme_bw()+    # Uses the black and white theme
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+  # Adds lines to the plot
  scale_color_viridis_d()  # Color-blind friendly palette
```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggsave(here("Xaringan Project", "Output", "Interactive_Plot.png"))
# Saves the plot
```

---
# Let's clean it up a bit

- Add a name in the code chunk for your plot

--

- Use the content class below around your code chunk to pull it to the left. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
.pull-left[code chunk]   # Pulls code chunk to the left
```

--

- Add **eval = FALSE** to the {r} bracket so it won't show the plot.

---
# Let's clean it up a bit

- Now add a code chunk below your plot's code chunk that includes what's below in the {r} bracket:

```{r eval=FALSE}
{r penguinplot-out, ref.label="penguinplot", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}  # Allows you to have your plot on the page without the code being attached
```

--

- Go ahead and add the content class to pull the plot to the right and add it around the code chunk.

---

# Now it should look like this!

.pull-left[
```{r penguinplot1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,    # The values that I want to plot
                            y = flipper_length_mm,
                            color = species))+ # Will base color off of species
  geom_point()+   # Makes a basic point plot
  theme_bw()+    # Uses the black and white theme
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+  # Adds lines to the plot
  scale_color_viridis_d()  # Color blind friendly palette
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r penguinplot1-out, ref.label="penguinplot", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```
]
---
# Think, Pair, Share

- Now it's time to think, pair, and share!!

- Create an **incremental slide**, with any picture, a chunk of code with highlights and an output using the penguins dataset

--

- An example could look like this:

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
penguins %>%   # The data frame
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm,  # The values that we want plotted for x and y
             y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  facet_grid(~island) + #<<     # facets the plot according to which island
  geom_point()  # Makes a basic point plot
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggsave(here("Xaringan Project", "Output", "Think_Pair_Share.png"))
# Saves the plot
```


---
#THANK YOU!!
